## Navier Stokes Equations, One of Seven Millennium Prize Problems by Clay Institute
Charles L. Fefferman wrote in the official problem description: **"Fluids are important and hard to understand**. There are many fascinating problems and conjectures about the behavior of solutions of the Euler and **Navier–Stokes equations**. **Since we don’t even know whether these solutions exist, our understanding is at a very primitive level... Instead, we probably need some deep, new ideas."**<br />
Human has always been curious about fluids, the earliest study about fluids dates back to pre-history.
