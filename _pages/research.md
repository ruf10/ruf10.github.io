**Navier Stokes Equations**, One of Seven Millennium Prize Problems by Clay Institute.
Charles L. Fefferman wrote in the official problem description: **"Fluids are important and hard to understand**. There are many fascinating problems and conjectures about the behavior of solutions of the Euler and **Navier–Stokes equations**. **Since we don’t even know whether these solutions exist, our understanding is at a very primitive level... Instead, we probably need some deep, new ideas."**

The history of human study fluids can date back to pre-history when the earliest human civilizations began near the shores of rivers. Important Mathematicians throughout history have devoted their life to the study of fuilds, from Archimedes(c.287 – c.212 BC) "Hydrostatics", "on floating Bodies", Newton(1642-1727) "Conservation of Linear Monentum", Daniel Bernoulli (1700- 1782) "Hydrodynamics", Euler(1707-1785), Cauchy(1789–1857). **In the early 19th century, Navier and Stokes gave the mathematical expression, conservation of momentum and conservation of mass for Newtonian fluids** Since then, Maxwell, Reynolds, Poincare...Richardson, and mathematitions today.
