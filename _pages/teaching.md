## MY STUDENTS LOVE ME AND MY TEACHING!
**THEY SAY that I teach in a way that everyone understands!**<br />
**THEY SAY that I am enthusiastic, eager to explain, kind, prepared, approachable, helpful, supportive, and well-spoken!** <br />
**THEY ALSO SAY that I am willing to go slow, allowing them to bring any questions, and I try my best to interact with them and help them!**<br />
