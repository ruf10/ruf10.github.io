***I fell in love with dancing at the age of 22 when I started the graduate program at the Math department of the University of Pittsburgh(Pitt)***.    <br />
I studied hard on the preliminary exams during my first year at Pitt and also did the other first years. We went to lectures and recitations and tried our best to gain knowledge with the help of professors and TAs. We created group studies, we discussed problems in the evenings during the weekdays, and on the weekends, we formed a tight bond.    <br />
Naturally, my colleagues and I started hanging out for fun things outside school and **that's when Salsa dancing, a Latin dance that emerged in Cuba, first came into my life.**
<br />

***I will never forget my first Salsa social dancing on a winter night***. I stepped onto the dancing floor from the outside, excited but more nervous. My math friend said Hi, and invited me to dance with him. Listening to salsa music, and feeling the enthusiasm from the people out there, I was warmed up and started enjoying the music and dancing to music. <br />
Since then, I have attended Salsa Dancing Club at Carnegie Mellon University regularly and learned Salsa dance and Bachata dances basic, other fun moves. I go to social dance to "show off" and practice. I love dancing with people. ** I feel that I was born to be a dancer**.
<br />

Last summer, I joined the Ballroom Dance Club at Carnegie Mellon University. I learn Latin Dances such as light and bubbly Cha-cha, sexy Rumba, lighthearted and cheery Samba, energetic Jive, and arrogant and passionate Paso Doble. I also love Standard Dances, which are elegant and classical, Waltz, Quickstep, Foxtrot, Tango, and Viennese Waltz.

***I go to ballroom competitions. The picture below was taken in November 2022 at the Ohio Star Ball collegiate ballroom competition, which is well-known and has a history of over 40 years. I placed 2nd place in International Latin Bronze level Cha-cha and Rumba, and 3rd place in International Standard Bronze level Waltz and Quickstep.*** I loved traveling with ballroom friends. We cheer for each other and support each other, and try our best to bring honor to our team!
