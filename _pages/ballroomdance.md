***I fell in love with dancing at the age of 22 when I started the graduate program at the Math department of the University of Pittsburgh(Pitt)***.    <br />
I studied hard on the preliminary exams during my first year at Pitt and also did the other first years. We went to lectures and recitations and tried our best to gain knowledge with the help of professors and TAs. We created group studies, we discussed problems in the evenings during the weekdays, and on the weekends, we formed a tight bond.    <br />
Naturally, my colleagues and I started hanging out for fun things outside school and **that's when Salsa dancing, a Latin dance that emerged in Cuba, first came into my life.**
<br />

***I will never forget my first Salsa dancing social at a winter night***. I stepped onto the dancing floor from the outside, I was excited but more nervous. My math friend said hi to me, and invited me to dance with him. Listening to the salsa music, and feeling the enthusiasm from the people out there, I was warmed up and started enjoying the music and dancing with music. <br />
Since then, I join the Salsa Dancing Club at the Carnegie Mellon University regularly, I learened Salsa dance basics, other fun moves, and also Bachata dance, and go to social dance to "show off" and pracice. **I love the dancing with people, I feel that I was born to be a dancer**.
<br />

Last summer, I joined the **Ballroom Dance Club at the Carnegie Mellon University**. For the people that are not familar with ballroom, I get to learn Latin Dances such as light and bubbly Cha-cha, sexy Rumba, ligthhearted and cheery Samba, energitic Jive, and arrogant and passionate Paso Doble. I also love Standard Dances which is very elegant and classical, Waltz, Quickstep, Foxtrot and Tango and Viennese Waltz. 

***I go for ballroom competitions. The below picture was taken in November 2022 at Ohio Star Ball collegiate ballroom compettion which is well-known, and it has a history over 40 years. I placed the 2nd place in International Latin Bronze level Cha-cha and Rumba, 3rd place in International Standard Bronze level Waltz and Quickstep.*** I loved travelling with ballroom friends and we cheer for each other and support each other, and try our best to bring the honor to our team!
