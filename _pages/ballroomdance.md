I fell in love with dancing at the age of 22 when I started the graduate program at the Math department of the University of Pittsburgh(Pitt).
I studied really hard on the prelimary exams during my first year at Pitt, and so the other first years. We went to the lectures, recitions, and tried our best to gain knowledges with the help of professors and TAs. Besides that we created group studies, we disccuss problems at the enevings during the weekdays, also on the weekends, we formed a tight bond with each other. Naturally, we started hanging out for fun things outside school, and that's when Salsa dancing, a latin dance that emerged in Cuba, first came into my life.
