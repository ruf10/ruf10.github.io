**My research interests is solving fluid dynamics problems using numerical methods, and combining with novel machine learning algorithms.** By taking Prof.Hajłasz, Prof. Jiang and Prof. Schikorra's lectures, I have solid math foundations. <br />
Also our math department at Pitt has a very strong numerical group. I have taken **8 core courses** from my thesis advisor Prof. Layton, Prof. Yotov and Prof. Neilan, which prepare for conducting research. <br />
Prof. Layton and I are working on the traditional numerical methods and also are interested in developping noval models that use machine learing and numerical methods to better approximate the fluid motion. <br />
