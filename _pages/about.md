My name is Rui Fang, and I am a math Ph.D. candidate at the University of Pittsburgh.  I am passionate about numerical analysis and scientific computing, and I am working on improving fluid flow simulation accuracy. My research explores penalty ensembles for the Navier-Stokes equations and combines machine learning techniques. As an Andrew Mellon Fellow 2023-2024, I am dedicating myself to my research.
