Iâ€™m Rui Fang, a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh, working under the guidance of Prof. William Layton ([webpage](https://www.mathematics.pitt.edu/people/ant-73)) in the numerical analysis group. My research focuses on enhancing the accuracy of fluid flow simulations by developing advanced methods, such as penalty ensembles for the Navier-Stokes equations. I am particularly excited about integrating machine learning techniques into these models to drive innovative solutions. As an Andrew Mellon Fellow for 2023-2024, I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of scientific computing and advancing fluid dynamics research.
