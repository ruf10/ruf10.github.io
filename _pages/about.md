Welcome to my website! I’m Rui Fang, a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh, working under the guidance of Prof. William Layton in the numerical analysis group. 
My research focuses on enhancing the accuracy of fluid flow simulations by developing advanced methods, such as penalty ensembles for the Navier-Stokes equations. I am particularly excited about integrating machine learning techniques into these models to drive innovative solutions. As an Andrew Mellon Fellow for 2023-2024, I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of scientific computing and advancing fluid dynamics research.<br />

### Service & leadership
**President of AWM (Association of Women in Mathematics)**:<br />
As the president of the AWM Pittsburgh Chapter, I host monthly graduate student seminars, inviting speakers from around the world to promote equal opportunities and encourage women to pursue careers in mathematics. I also organize coffee chats and semester-end dinners to foster community and engagement. Additionally, I collaborate with the University of Pittsburgh's Girls' Summer Math Camp, inspiring girls from diverse backgrounds to become future mathematicians, engineers, and scientists.
