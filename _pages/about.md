Iâ€™m Rui Fang, a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh, working under the guidance of Prof. William Layton ([webpage](https://www.mathematics.pitt.edu/people/ant-73)) in the numerical analysis group. My research focuses on enhancing the accuracy of fluid flow simulations by developing advanced methods, such as penalty ensembles for the Navier-Stokes equations. I am particularly excited about integrating machine learning techniques into these models to drive innovative solutions. As an Andrew Mellon Fellow for 2023-2024, I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of scientific computing and advancing fluid dynamics research.

### Summary
- Improved the predictability, accuracy, and efficiency of fluid flow simulations by addressing data uncertainty and the chaotic behavior of flows.
- Authored 3 solo papers and 4 co-authored papers ([Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rui-Fang-39)).
- Delivered 4 conference talks in the United States and internationally. 
- Awards: Andrew W. Mellon Fellow 2023-2024.
- 2nd Place in 3-Minute Thesis competition, Math Department, University of Pittsburgh.
- President of AWM (Association of Women in Mathematics), Officer of Math GSO (Graduate Student Organization).
- Referee of Pittsburgh Interdisciplinary Mathematics Review (PIMR), peer-reviewed open-access journal ([Website](https://pimr.pitt.edu/pimr/)).

### Services and Leadership
**As the president of the AWM (Association of Women in Mathematics) Pittsburgh Chapter**, I host monthly graduate student seminars, inviting speakers from around the world to promote equal opportunities and encourage women to pursue careers in mathematics. I also organize coffee chats and semester-end dinners to foster community and engagement. Additionally, I collaborate with the University of Pittsburgh's Girls' Summer Math Camp, inspiring girls from diverse backgrounds to become future mathematicians, engineers, and scientists.

**As a student leader of the Mathematics GSO (Graduate Student Organization)**, I coordinate open houses for prospective graduate students and organize social events such as the fall picnic, end-of-year party, and summer gatherings. I also address graduate student concerns about teaching and preliminary exams, serving as a bridge between students and the faculty.
