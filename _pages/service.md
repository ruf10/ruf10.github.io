In addition to my research, I serve as president of the Association of Women in Mathematics (AWM) Pittsburgh Chapter, student officer for the Math Graduate Student Organization (GSO), referee for the Pittsburgh Interdisciplinary Mathematics Review (PIMR), an undergraduate peer-reviewed journal, and graduate student organizer for University of Pittsburgh High School Girls' Math Summer Camp. I actively promote diversity in mathematics, mentor the next generation, and foster a supportive academic community. I was honored as an Andrew Mellon Fellow for 2023-2024.

## President of the AWM (Association of Women in Mathematics) Pittsburgh Chapter
I host monthly graduate student seminars, inviting speakers worldwide to promote equal opportunities and encourage women to pursue careers in mathematics. I also organize coffee chats and semester-end dinners to foster community and engagement. Additionally, I collaborate with the University of Pittsburgh's Girls' Summer Math Camp, inspiring girls from diverse backgrounds to become future mathematicians, engineers, and scientists.

## Student leader of the Mathematics GSO (Graduate Student Organization)
I coordinate open houses for prospective graduate students and organize social events such as the fall picnic, end-of-year party, and summer gatherings. I also address graduate student concerns about teaching and preliminary exams, serving as a bridge between students and the faculty.<br />
