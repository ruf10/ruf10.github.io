## President of the AWM (Association of Women in Mathematics) Pittsburgh Chapter
I host monthly graduate student seminars, inviting speakers from around the world to promote equal opportunities and encourage women to pursue careers in mathematics. I also organize coffee chats and semester-end dinners to foster community and engagement. Additionally, I collaborate with the University of Pittsburgh's Girls' Summer Math Camp, inspiring girls from diverse backgrounds to become future mathematicians, engineers, and scientists.

## Student leader of the Mathematics GSO (Graduate Student Organization)** <br />
I coordinate open houses for prospective graduate students and organize social events such as the fall picnic, end-of-year party, and summer gatherings. I also address graduate student concerns about teaching and preliminary exams, serving as a bridge between students and the faculty.
