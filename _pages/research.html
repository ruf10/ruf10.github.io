Fluids in motion show complex phenomena that are challenging to predict but are crucial in technology, engineering, and science including renewable energy and weather forecasting. In the above figure, we can see the comparison of the Von Karman vortices that appeared in the flow over Rishiri Island and a numerical simulation on a 2d cylinder in the figure. <br />
I develop accurate and efficient numerical algorithms to extend the predictability horizon for the simulation of turbulent flows by addressing data uncertainty and the chaotic behavior of flows. Advancements in these methods are essential for studying climate patterns, energy production, and global warming. <br / >
My research interests include data simulation, machine learning, deep learning, probabilistic graphical models, deep reinforcement learning, numerical analysis, scientific computing, computational fluid dynamics, finite element methods, ensemble simulations, and turbulence modeling. <br />
I have authored 7 peer-reviewed publications including 3 solo and 4 co-authored on topics including the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE), adaptive penalty methods, ensemble simulations, data assimilation with nudging, Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) models, and deep learning applications. I am currently working on two projects: data assimilation for correcting model errors, which will soon appear on arXiv, and additional uniqueness of solutions for the 1-equation turbulence model of Prandtl and Kolmogorov. Additionally, I have delivered 4 conference talks in the United States and internationally. <br />
